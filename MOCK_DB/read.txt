Roles on Trello have been assigned.

I sent everyone a link to the Mockaroo Project I created. Check your work emails.

I pushed the SQL script to the main branch of the repo.

I had to leave the foreign key references null in order to enter the mock data.

Simply add the foreign keys manually using the ALTER TABLE or INSERT INTO queries if you need to, for testing.

Feel free to TRUNCATE or DROP if you need to make changes.

This is just something to get us started so we can do some testing of our code.

I'm still waiting on Stephen for confirmation of QC and test times tomorrow.

For now, let's study and we'll start working on project after the exams.

If you want to do some solo coding, make sure to update us in the comment section of the Trello task card.

Let's focus on login and register for now. We want to get an understanding of how the back end will communicate with the front end, before we start tackling the other tasks. Try to work together when possible, but always push to your own branch.

We'll have team meetings after work when applicable to come to a consensus on our direction moving forward.

Remember to post comments in the Trello tasks cards, so I can quickly look over them, check the repo changes, and post an update to the readme.

Remember to do the Coding Challenge practice and study for the test tomorrow.

Some of the Test topics:

Study OOP:

abstraction - Hiding implementation

encapsulation - restricting access

inheritance - reusability, no redundant code, child classes

polymorphism - overwriting and overloading, "many forms"


non access modifier:

anstract - method doesn't need implementation

static - 

final - variable is immutable, class can not be inherited


Access modifiers:

public - global

private - class

protected - sub class/package

default - package


Exceptions:

Checked - compile-time

Unchecked - run-time


SQL:

Scalar and Aggregate functions


Also catch up PDP if you're behind

## This is the first version of our readme

So far, Treyvon was able to push an example of Spring to the repo

I cloned it and pushed as the main branch

*Reminder* create your own branches before pushing to the repo

"git branch [branch-name]" or just use vscode to create/switch branches

I want to start administering roles in Trello, so start sending me what you feel like working on so I can update the cards

Keep watch notifications on for Documentation, because I plan to update this readme often
