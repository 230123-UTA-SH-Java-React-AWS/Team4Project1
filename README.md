# Team 4 a.k.a "Work in Progress"
## Description
This is a banking app created with React. Upon connecting to this app, the user is presented with a landing page that has a Navbar allowing the user to register/login. This webapp is organized with a grid layout and components on the frontend. With these tools we are able to achieve a truly dynamic SPA. We have frontend and backend validation. Upon logging in the user is able to view/update their profile information. This updated information is reflected on the component immediately upon validation. The user has the option to create a new account or view the details of any existing accounts. From here the user may decide to transfer funds between their accounts. The user is able to cancel operations and return to prior component states, as well as logout at anytime. Transactions history/details are tracked and displayed to the user as well.

###
A cloud DB was integrated late in development to test validity and consistency of data. Env variables were used and the app passed Unit testing.
