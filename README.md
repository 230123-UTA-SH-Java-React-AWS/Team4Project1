# Team 4 a.k.a "Work in Progress"
## Description
This is a banking app created with React. This webapp is organized with a grid layout and components on the frontend. By passing props down to different components and refreshing their states through the use of the Redux store, we are able to achieve a truly dynamic SPA. Users are able to register or login on the landing page. We have frontend and backend validation. Using React Redux and Axios we are able to send HTTP requests to the backend. With this we are able to create RESTFUL API endpoints and we handle the requests with our backend Controllers. These requests are subsequently sent to the proper Service methods. These corresponding methods contact the Repository layer where the data in the DB is either retreived or updated. A Response is returned to the client.
###
A cloud DB was integrated late in development to test validity and consistency of data. Env variables were used and the app passed Unit testing.
