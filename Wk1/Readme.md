# Fullstack Big Picture
* Full stack technology refers to the entire depth of a computer system application, and full stack developers straddle two separate development domains: the front end and the back end
* The front end includes everything that a client, or site viewer, can see and interact with
* Back end developers, in contrast, refine the software code that communicates with servers, databases, or other proprietary software that conveys information to front end interfaces
* Both front end and back end are called full stack developers, meaning they are well versed in both disciplines

# What is an Operating System? (OS)
* An operating system, or "OS," is software that communicates with the hardware and allows other programs to run. It is comprised of system software, or the fundamental files your computer needs to boot up and function. Every desktop computer, tablet, and smartphone includes an operating system that provides basic functionality for the device

# Basic Unix/Linux commands
* One of your main ways of interacting with your computer
* Flags (ex: -a, -v, -s) are used to change the behavior of a command
1. pwd – shows the current location of your terminal
2. Ls – lists files and directories
3. Cd – Changes the current directory
4. Mkdir – Creates a directory
5. Touch – creates a file
6. Cat – views the file (also can combine two files together) 
7. Cp – copies a file and paste it on a specified location
8. Mv – move a file to a directory
9. Rm – removes a file (use –r to remove a directory and all its content)
10. Diff – shows the difference between two files line by line
11. Grep – Searches for specific texts within a file and prints that entire line

# Linear Data Structures
## Array
* An array is typically going to be the most basic form of data structure that you'll find in any given programming language. An array is an index-based linear collection of elements. More often than not, we collect items of similar data types within an array, which makes it much easier to work with the data
* Allows random access with zero-based index
* **Fixed size**
## Linked List
* Dynamically changing size meaning they can increase or decrease in size
* Efficient in inserting, deleting, or shifting the position of elements inside the list
## Stack
* Last In First Out (LIFO) or First In Last Out (FILO) ordering
* Conceptualize stacks using a stack of plates placed in a box
* Ex: The back button functionality of your browser follows a stack data structure
## Queue
* First In First Out (FIFO) order
* Conceptualize stacks using a line forming to buy some movie tickets
* Ex: Joining an online game with a massive player base

# Git
* Version Control System (VCS)
* Maintain multiple versions of code
* An ability to go back to any previous version
* Developers can work in parallel
* Audit traceability with clear picture on whom, which when, where and what are the changes.
* Synchronize the code
* Copy/Merge/Undo the changes
* Find out the difference between versions
* Review the history of the change

## Three states:
* Figure out the git commands necessary to move to each state
* New/Modified – a new file was added or changed
* Staged – Files added to this state will be ready to be committed
* Committed – means the data is permanent and saved

## Git commands
* Every command will start with “git”
* Git init – initializes git and create a repository
* Git status – Checks the current state of each file
* Git add – tracks new/modified files within the repo (git add . Will add all files into staging)
* Git commit –m “message” – commits all the changes we have done and attach a message to it
* Git remote add - will add the location of the remote repo
* Git push - will push all changes from the local repo to the remote repo
* Git pull - will pull all changes from the remote repo to the local repo

## Github vs Git
* Github and Git are **NOT** the same
* Github is a remote repository
* It stores your repository online
* Mainly used to share your application to multiple people
* Multiple people can also contribute to the remote repository

# Algorithms
* A set of instructions that aims to solve a problem or operation

## Time Complexity
* Measures the growth of your algorithm number of operations as sample size/input increases
* Big-Oh notation. Using this notation, we might say, for example, that an algorithm has a running time that is O(n^2) or O(n) or O(log(n)). These notations are read "Big-Oh of n squared," "Big-Oh of n," and "Big-Oh of log n" 

## Common Big O notations
* O(1) : Constant time
* O(N) : Linear time
* O(N^2) : Quadratic time
* O(log(n)) : Logarithmic time

# Java
* high-level and compiled programming language
* Strongly-typed - datatypes are enforced and cannot be changed (unless it can be casted)
* Object-Oriented programming style
* Platform independent
* Automatic memory management

## Main method
* This is the method that is executed at the very beginning of your java app.

## Classes
* the blueprints for how to create objects that contain a certain state 
* **this** keyword is used to reference any of the class members of a class
* **super** keyword is used to reference any of the class members of a parent/super class

### Class members
* Constructor
    * When we use the new keyword in order to create an object, the JVM is invoking a special class member called a constructor.
    * Declares how an object is to be instantiated and initialized from the class 
* Method
    * Used to specify a behavior or functionality you want the object to have
    * Parameters are used to add inputs to a method
    * Return datatype is used to specify the output of a method
* Field
    * Stores information
    * Usually private to keep encapsulation
* Getters
    * Like methods but are specifically responsible for getting information from fields
    * Allows fields to be readable
    * Naming convention: setField(datatype field)
* Setters
    * Like methods but are specifically responsible for setting information for fields
    * Allows fields to be writable
    * Naming convention: getField()

### Static non-access modifier
* The class or class member belongs to the class
* static field will share its value across multiple objects
* static method will be accessible without create an object from the class
* static class will force every class member within the class to be static as well

## Casting
* The process of converting a data type to another data type
### Explicit Casting
* When the end result of the conversion might result in information loss
* Must specify (datatype)variableName explicitly
* Ex: Converting a double into an integer
### Implicit Casting
* When the end result will not result in loss of information
* Your compiler will do the conversion for you
* Ex: Converting an integer to a double

## Primitive datatypes
* Datatype is defined by the language itself
* It stores the value directly into the stack memory
```
| Datatype | Memory         | What it stores                |
|----------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| boolean  | Depends on JVM | True or False                 |
| byte     | 8-bit          | numerical, integer values     |
| short    | 16-bit         | numerical, integral values    |
| char     | 16-bit         | numerical & single characters |
| int      | 32-bit         | numerical, integral values    |
| long     | 64-bit         | numerical, integral values    |
| float    | 32-bit         | floating values, more precise |
| double   | 64-bit         | floating values               |
```

## Reference datatypes
* reference variables only store the location of the actual value
* reference variables are stored in the stack
* actual object/value is stored in the heap
* Ex: arrays, Strings, and objects

## Working with operators
* Check operator demo to see the different types of operators

## Flow Control Statements
* If statements - checks a condition and execute block of code is condition is satisfied
    * else if - checks another condition of previous ifs failed
    * else - executes if none of the if statements executed
* Switch statements - checks a variable and compares it to several cases
    * break - keyword needed to stop a case from executing the next case
    * default - acts like an else in if statements
* For loop - will iterate multiple times as long as its condition is satisfied
    * first block will instantiate a temporary variable
    * second block is the condition being check to loop again
    * third block is the change of the temporary variable
* For loop enhanced - will iterate through an array
    * Easier to read if you just need to go through each element inside of an array
* While loop - will keep repeating the loop until the condition is no longer satisfied
    * Useful if you don't know when to stop the loop
* do-While loop - will execute at least once regardless if the condition was satisfied

## Package and Imports
* Packages
    * They are essentially virtual folders that Java utilizies to organize your classes together
* Import
    * They will import a specific package so you can utilize the classes that is within that package

## Strings
* Reference types
* They are stored in a special place called the **String Pool** which is inside the heap memory
* String Pools
    * If there is an existing String that matches in the String Pool, the reference variable will point to the existing value
    * **Duplicates** will not exist in the String Pool

## Exceptions
* They are **NOT** Errors
* **Every exceptions inherits the Exception class**
* They can be handled by utilizing try-catch statements
    * You can have multiple catch statements
    * Ideally, you want the most specific exception first before you become more generic
* Errors are things that cannot be handled by try-catch statement
    * Ex: Stackoverflow error
### Checked Exceptions
* They are exceptions detected by your compiler and will force you to handle the exception usually by using the try-catch statement
### Unchecked Exceptions
* They are exceptions ignored by your compiler and will force another entity that utilizes that method to handle it instead
* You used the throws keyword after the method signature

# Test-Driven Development (TDD)
* The TDD process consists of writing unit tests first, before the implemented application code has been written
* The implemented application code can be written to make the test pass 
* If we mess up somewhere, when the unit tests are run we can pinpoint exactly where the problem lies

## Unit Test
* Whole idea is to test a single tiny portion of your source code
    * Hence, Unit is in the name to indicate small
* The goal of the unit test is to isolate the scope into just that one method or that one function
    * To make debugging easier to deal with

## JUnit
* Open-source framework that is used for writing and executing unit tests in Java programming language
* Annotations are used to support, identify, and execute test method features
* Assertions are used to check actual output versus expected output
* AAA
    * Arrange - Specify what you need for this unit test
    * Act - Where you specify the actual method that needs to be tested
    * Assert - Where you validate if the method actually worked as intended

# Generics
* Enforce compile time safety by allowing you to use parameterized types
* TLDR it is like a placeholder in a class
    * Whenever you make an object out of that class, you can specify the datatype to replace every generic from that class
```Java
//Every reference of "T" will be replaced depending on the datatype at initialization of this class
//MyGenericClass<Integer> someObj = new MyGenericClass<>(); - it will replace every "T" into Integer
//MyGenericClass<String> someObj = new MyGenericClass<>(); - it will replace every "T" into String instead
public class MyGenericClass<T> {
  private T instance;
  
  // simple generic setter method
  public void setObject(T object) {
    this.instance = object;
  }
}
```

# SDLC
* Software Development LifeCycle
* Application of standard business practices to building software applications
## Planning
* Calculate if the idea is feasible both financially and current technology advancements
* Lots of meetings and discussion between project leaders, stakeholders, teams, etc.
* Feedback from customers
## Define Requirements
* Actual feasible steps required to get the finished product.
* Think of features this product will have
## Design and Prototyping
* Defining what technologies, you will utilize to create the product
* There are many different market/companies/products/technologies that offer the same thing but a little bit different
## Software Development
* Actual code writing to make the product
## Testing
* Creating test cases to check that the finished product can satisfy the defined requirements
* Best way to verify that your finished product will have all the features you planned in the beginning
## Deployement
* Create a way to get your finished product in the hands of the customers
* Mostly automated for us
* HOWEVER, this step is very important because it can make or break a product’s impressions
* Ex: Creating a website or a whole logistical plan to get finished products from the factories to the stores
## Maintenance and Updates
* Users may find bugs that needs fixing later
* We can add future updates to our apps as well

## Waterfall
* One of the popular SDLC model first introduced in the 1970s that is still used today
* Each phase needs to be completed in order and will not proceed to the next phase until finish
* A more linear approach
* Simple model to follow
* Rigid and not flexible
* Slow in development and deploying
* Each phases are clearly defined and well documented

## Agile
* The current leading SDLC that most companies follow
* You focus on a subset of features and go through each phase until you can deploy 
* Focuses strongly on user experience and feedback
* Flexible and responsive
* Fast deployment of product
* Huge amount of communication required
* Unclear timelines and deadlines

# HTTP
* HyperText Transfer Protocol
* A technique of transmitting data in a particular format, primarily between a server and a browser. It uses an architecture in which a client makes a connection to a server, makes a request, and waits for the response

## HTTP Workflow
1. The client makes a request to the server
2. The server creates an appropriate response depending on the request
3. The server sends the response back to the client
4. The client's browser will display the response to the client

## HTTP Verb/Method
* GET - Retrieve data from the server
* POST - Send data to the server
* PUT - Update existing data from the server
* DELETE - Deletes an existing data 

## HTTP Status Code
* Informational responses (100–199)
* Successful responses (200–299)
* Redirection messages (300–399)
* Client error responses (400–499)
* Server error responses (500–599)

# Moar Java
* Things Java is doing at the backend that we don't really see when we run our code
## JDK, JRE, JVM
* JDK - Java Development Kit, which provides developer tools like a compiler, debugger, documentation tools, and other command-line utilities.
* JRE - Java Runtime Environment contains all the runtime libraries that your code will be calling and using
* JVM - Java Virtual Machine. The JVM is a special program that knows how to execute the programs that you write in Java

## Stack and Heap
* Stack
    * Contains primitive values that are specific to a method and references to objects referred from the method that are in a heap
    * Access to this memory is in Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order
* Heap
    * Heap space is used for the dynamic memory allocation of Java objects and JRE classes at runtime. New objects are always created in heap space.
    * If heap space is full, Java throws java.lang.OutOfMemoryError
    * It needs Garbage Collector to free up unused objects

## Garbage Collection
* The automatic process of removing objects from the heap which have no references to them
* In lower-level programming languages, memory is manipulated directly in the code, but Java abstracts these details away from the developer by allowing the JVM to handle memory management itself
* Garbage collection is run in the background by the JVM. There is **no way we can explicitly force garbage collection to happen**
    * We can suggest GC to collect unused object using System.gc()

## Queue Interface
* The Queue places objects on a “waiting list”, typically based on First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
* Useful for storing objects prior to processing
* Elements are added to the tail of the queue
* Elements can be "popped" off the frot of the queue
* Methods include:
    * add(Object obj) - adds object to queue
    * peek() - Returns the first Object in line but it will not remove it from the queue
    * poll() - Return the first Object in line and removes it from the queue
